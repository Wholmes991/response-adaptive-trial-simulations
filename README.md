# response-adaptive-trial-simulations
Code for simulating various response-adaptive clinical trial designs. To be used along side the paper 
"Updating Allocation Ratios in Response Adaptive Designs using Multi-Armed Bandits and Other Popular Designs"

In a more pragmatic and less theoretical approach, we look past the \perfect conditions" and
investigate our main objective: how varying the frequency of updates to patient allocation
probabilities impacts on the operating characteristics of a response-adaptive clinical trial.

By assuming the time period between updates corresponds to the delay in patient responses,
we also look to provide insight into how delayed responses can affect a response-adaptive
trial's operating characteristics. Delayed (patient) responses are a reality in clinical trials
and occur when a desired end-point is not available for sometime after treatment (ranging
from hours to years).

By investigating our objectives, we hope to give trial investigators reliable data and pertinent
insight into how one may plan a response-adaptive trial to minimise complexities, whilst still
obtaining the signifcant benefits of the design used.
